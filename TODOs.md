# Periodicity test - DONE
For each of the two grids, check different numbers of copies of the domains before periodicity is applied. Keep other parameters fixed. Save values of k.

# Test on mesh independence
For each of the two grids, check different mesh refinements. Keep other parameters fixed. Check results on paraview and save values of k.

# Test on mesh parameters
For each of the two grids, check different parameters for mesh creation. Keep refinement fixed. Save values of k.

# Angle of attack test
For each of the two grids, test different angles of attack. Keep other parameters fixed. Save values of k.

# Speed test
For each of the two grids, test different speeds. Keep other parameters fixed. Save values of k.

# Scaling test
For each of the two grids, check performace scaling over multiple cores. Keep other parameters fixed. Use both a small mesh and a big one. Save execution time.
